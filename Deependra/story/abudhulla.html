        <h3>Abdullah’s Zardosi Gave His Mom’s Boutique A Fresh Spin!</h3>
        <p>
          Indians' shopping and payment habits have evolved over the course of
          the last few years, thanks to the rise of the internet and digital
          payments. This mode of payment has radically altered the way retailers
          go about conducting their business- revolutionizing the way merchants
          accept payments at their outlets, irrespective of the industry or the
          size of their business. In addition to accepting digital payments,
          merchants can also avail of unsecured loans to help scale their
          business via the new-age fintech platforms, manage their business
          transactions better, invest and earn, as well as build their business
          more efficiently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Digital payments may seem to have a microscopic impact on the overall
          business story, but that’s not true. There are numerous success
          stories that speak volumes about the way BharatPe has empowered the
          ambitious minds nestled away in the furthest folds of the country.
          While it takes an insistent mind to make it big, it also takes
          something like BharatPe to believe in their dreams and offer them the
          proverbial wings to fly. You never know how far one can go from their
          first step, and sometimes all that remains between one and their
          success is a vote of confidence. Today, we are here to share the story
          of Abdullah Hasan, a vendor in Indore who took on his mom’s clothing
          store and expanded it exponentially, all at the young age of 24!
        </p>
        <p>
          Abdullah had been involved in his mother’s venture, a boutique by the
          name of Akshant, for 3+ years. He used to showcase their collection at
          various garment exhibitions. In the history-bending year of 2020, not
          anticipating the global pandemic to hit the world, the boutique had to
          be shut due to losses and lack of footfall, owing to the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abdullah started Zardosi, a dedicated outlet for women’s clothing that
          offered an extensive range of readymade garments and dress materials,
          including suit materials, kurtis, sarees, etc. He started his venture
          by taking a loan of Rs. 3 lakhs from his mother. At the time, he
          realized that customers are more comfortable accepting digital
          payments and installed BharatPe QR at his store. This really helped
          him to continue growing his business, even during the challenging
          times of the pandemic.
        </p>
        <p>
          To promote his venture, Abdullah explored participation in exhibitions
          across Indore. This helped him to drive more customers to his store.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abduallah also availed business loans from BharatPe, to scale his
          business. He took his first loan of Rs. 7 lakhs and utilized the funds
          to increase the inventory and the shop area in his store. Later in the
          same year, he took another loan of Rs. 5 lakhs, which he used for
          starting an additional product line of handbags and clutches in his
          store. Overall, there has been a 40% increase in his business in the
          last one and a half years.
        </p>
        <p>
          Abdullah’s family consists of his grandparents, sister, and mother.
          His mother also helps him in his business currently. Today, he uses
          BharatPe’s QR and Speakers, and has also availed loans from the
          company to scale his business manifold.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you ask him about his experience with BharatPe, he shares that he
          values the partnership with BharatPe and rates them high on the
          customer experience front.
        </p>
        <p>
          Speaking about the future, Abdullah dreams of completing his Masters
          degree. While his company has an established name in the market today,
          he aspires to be a part of exhibitions across the country and promote
          his brand. For his peers doing business, Abdullah stresses on the
          importance of business knowledge and doing a thorough market study,
          before to starting any new venture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Full of wisdom at such a young age, and driven to succeed, Abdullah
          represents our modern India. Armed with big ideas and ready to take
          help where available, they are committed to make their dreams a
          reality.
