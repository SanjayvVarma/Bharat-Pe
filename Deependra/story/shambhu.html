        <h3>BharatPe Loan Making Teatime Sweeter!</h3>
        <p>
          Digital payments have surely swooped in and changed the way Indians
          shop or pay. Whether it's shopping, paying bills, or paying merchants
          for services, digital payments have irrevocably revolutionized daily
          commerce, and paper currency is almost archaic. That means business
          owners have also had no option but to evolve as well, whether it's a
          tea stall vendor or the independent corner cafe owner.
        </p>
        <p>
          Equipping small business owners to walk the tide was crucial to ensure
          that these young businesses are catching up and growing alongside, and
          that's a big ask. Since its early days, BharatPe has been committed to
          empowering these small businesses with best-in-class fintech products
          that can help growth of their businesses. Even during the times of
          Covid, the company continued to empower emerging businesses and
          address their credit needs by facilitating unsecured loans, in
          partnership with RBI-approved NBFCs. Rs 3,600 crore in loan
          disbursalss were facilitated to more than 1.2 lakh merchants in the
          first quarter of the financial year 2022-23 itself, and lives impacted
          were real people, grappling for that helping hand and thriving once
          that was enabled.
        </p>
        <p>
          While big numbers and percentages can feel a little cold and blurry,
          it's the real story that puts things into perspective. It's when we
          get to see lives changing and thriving, it warms the heart,
          highlighting the depth of the change that BharatPe is making in a very
          real and tangible way. We are here to talk about a tea stall owner
          from Lucknow who went from being a roadside tea stall vendor to now
          owning his new tea showroom, all the while sharing India’s favorite
          beverage- tea!
        </p>
        <p>
          Shambhu, a Lucknow resident for over 10 years, originally is from
          Jharkhand. At the tender age of 15 years, Shambhu had to leave his
          education to help his father with his tea stall. Why? The helping
          hands in the tea stall kept leaving and never coming back. However,
          his fate was put to test when after a family tiff, Shambhu was forced
          to stop working for his father and he set up his own tea stall
          instead, around 2- 2.5 years back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Shambhu Tea Stall in Patrakarpuram Road, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow is now a
          familiar name, but owning a roadside tea stall was less than ideal, as
          one would imagine. He had to battle monetary problems as well as the
          elements of nature, as a rainy day might mean the shop not opening for
          business for the day. His earnings were meagre and he was struggling
          to make ends meet. That is when he applied for his first loan via the
          BharatPe app. The loan helped him stand on his feet and open a proper
          tea stall. He applied for a second loan of Rs. 2.20 lacs to further
          expand his business. Being associated with BharatPe for almost two
          years Shambhu claims that his life has turned around, and he is now
          earning around Rs 1 lakh per month.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sometimes all that stands between one person and his dreams is a
          helping hand, and BharatPe was all the helping hand Shambhu needed to
          make it big. The two loans helped the roadside tea stall vendor become
          a business owner and helped make his dreams a reality. Apart from the
          loan, the BharatPe Swipe machine and UPI QR have helped his customers
          with payment flexibility. Hassle-free loan application and the option
          to repay the loan in easy daily installments have ensured that Shambhu
          doesn't have to struggle with anything.
        </p>
        <p>
          And that is just one story. Whether it's your neighborhood tea stall
          or your corner grocery store, everybody has the potential to realize
          their dreams especially with BharatPe standing strong by their side.
