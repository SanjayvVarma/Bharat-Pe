            <h3>How BharatPe helped Surender Singh build his own business</h3>
            <p id="italic">Meet Surender Singh, a young business owner, who started with a job in a store, just like the one that he owns today. Read about his dreams, his struggle in the early years, and how today, with the support of BharatPe, he owns and successfully runs his own supermarket in Gururgam!</p>
            <h4>The Challenge</h4>
            <p>Surender quit a monthly paying job and started out with a small kirana store with his life’s savings. Over time, his business started doing well. He made enough money to add new offerings/product categories to the store that are attractive to his old and new customers. He started accepting digital payments through card as well as UPI QR, and offered home deliveries to ensure customer stickiness, in the difficult times of the pandemic.</p>
            <p>However, he soon realized that his additional earnings were not enough for him to expand his business, which could take years. He tried to get a loan from a bank but since he did not have a credit history, it didn’t work in his favour. Also, other money lenders were not an option for him as they were charging very high interest rates.</p>
            <h4>The Solution</h4>
            <p>Surender is well-aware of digital payments and the new-age Fintech companies. He had been using BharatSwipe, the POS machine by BharatPe and its UPI QR for payment acceptance for a few months. He found them convenient and was quick to understand that they are important as the customers preferred them.</p>
            <p>Digital payment was a saviour for Surender, during the Covid times. With digital payments, he could ensure his sales didn’t dip but instead, increased, during the times of the pandemic. He saw an opportunity to make his business bigger.</p>
            <p>It was on one of the occasions when he was going through some of the marketing-related communication sent by BharatPe, that he realized that the company could solve his credit problem. He decided to take a chance and applied for a loan via the BharatPe app and was amazed to see that the loan process was 100% digital. He put in a request online and within 3-4 days of applying, the funds were disbursed into his bank account.</p>
            <h4>The Outcome</h4>
            <p>In June 2020, Surender opened Arab Supermarket in Gurugram. He used the loan facilitated by BharatPe to set up the new shop as well as offer products across categories to customers.</p>
            <p>With BharatPe, he has not only been able to offer convenience to his customers even in the pandemic, but also has been able to expand his business even in the middle of such turbulent times. His earnings have grown manifold- because of the two shops as well as digital payment acceptance facility.</p>
            <p>BharatPe is his preferred fintech partner for all of his future ventures - big and small!</p>
            <p><b>Listen to Surender Singh tell his story of digital empowerment.</b></p>
