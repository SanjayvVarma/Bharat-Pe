        <h3>A hotelier in Tirupati expands his business with BharatPe</h3>
        <p>
          Access to formal credit in India is limited due to a lack of adequate
          credit information, lengthy application processes, and extensive
          paperwork. The void is being filled by new-age digital lenders who are
          leveraging cutting-edge technology and alternative credit assessment
          models to address the needs of the unbanked. Due to its strong focus
          on unsecured consumption loans delivered at the point of sale, digital
          lending is becoming extremely successful. It is expected by 2030,
          digital lending can offer an opportunity of approximately INR 104
          trillion, as per a report by Praxis Global Alliance.
        </p>
        <p>
          BharatPe facilitates collateral-free merchant loans to offline
          businesses and SMEs, via a completely online process with minimum
          documents. BharatPe’s merchant loan allows merchants to avail loans in
          the range of Rs 20,000 to Rs 10 lakhs for up to 15 months tenure, at
          competitive interest rates. The merchants can repay the loan through a
          daily repayment mechanism which makes loan repayment a hassle-free
          exercise.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story of Sreekanth Y who runs Hotel Surya and restaurant
          Ramakrishna Bhojnalay in the holy city of Tirupati is one such story
          among the myriads of stories of BharatPe empowering a merchant with
          much-needed access to credit, that in turn enabled him to scale his
          business. Sreekanth is a first-generation entrepreneur who started his
          hotel around 7 years ago. After working for 18 years as a Kitchen
          Supervisor in a hotel, Sreekanth decided to don the entrepreneurial
          hat. He started his entrepreneurial journey by leasing a 12-room hotel
          opposite the railway station in Tirupati and named it Hotel Surya. The
          hotel offered a comfortable stay at an affordable price and became a
          success with positive word of mouth in a very short span of time.
        </p>
        <p>
          The hotel business was running smoothly but Sreekanth noticed that
          most of the visitors who were staying at his hotel were enquiring
          about the dining facility at the hotel and when they found that the
          hotel didn’t have any, they asked the hotel staff to help with a
          pocket-friendly dining facility in the vicinity of the hotel. This
          made Sreekanth realize the need to start a pocket-friendly vegetarian
          restaurant that could cater to those who were staying at the hotel.
          Soon, Sreekanth started a restaurant by the name of Ramakrishna
          Bhojnalay in his hotel offering fresh vegetarian food at
          pocket-friendly prices. The restaurant has emerged as a sought-after
          place for travelers looking for homely food.
        </p>
        <p>
          Both businesses of Sreekanth were running smoothly until Covid induced
          lockdown impacted them severely. Once the lockdown was lifted and
          business restarted, Sreekanth noticed that things were not what they
          use to be before the lockdown. There was a change in consumer behavior
          and a sudden surge in preference for digital payments. This is when a
          BharatPe agent visited his hotel in November 2021 and apprised him of
          the benefits of installing a QR code. Sreekanth started using
          BharatPe’s UPI QR for accepting digital payments and noticed that it
          was creating a positive impact on the customers, who felt safer using
          digital payments as an option.
        </p>
        <p>
          Post a month, the BharatPe agent told Sreekanth about the merchant
          loan facility and its features. Sreekanth found the loan option
          attractive and decided to avail a loan of Rs. 7 lakhs in Dec. 2021 to
          grow his business. Using the funds, he bought a neighboring tea and
          coffee shop and named it Café Mumbai.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sreekanth’s story is the story of a man following his gut instinct to
          rise in life. This is the story of how conviction and hard work can
          enable anyone to make their dreams a reality.
